# Track Your CO2 Emissions with co2.js

It's your turn to take action! Utilize [co2.js](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2-js/) to monitor the CO2 emissions of a basic Fastify server. A starting point is provided in the skeleton folder, where a simple Fastify server is already set up. Your task is to implement a middleware that measures the CO2 emissions of **all** incoming and outgoing messages (all requests). The CO2 tracking results should be accessible via the root (`/`) endpoint or whatever you choose. BONUS: Don't use the general paramets, but use the grid composition for your country.

Unleash your creativity! Explore the [documentation](https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/co2js/overview/), absorb the knowledge it offers, and strategize your tracking approach.
